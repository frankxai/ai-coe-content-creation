### LinkedIn Post 1 - "AI Startups: Compute Is Strategy Now"

Late September 2025 made one thing obvious: compute access is no longer a back-office concern. NVIDIA just pledged GBP 2B to the UK ecosystem and is evaluating a $500M investment in Wayve. Founders who can prove multi-region GPU resilience--and show how safety metrics trend down week over week--win the next term sheets. I broke down the five signals every AI startup must act on (compute, safety telemetry, synthetic environments, embodied autonomy, ambient interfaces) plus the 30-day execution plan. Link in comments.

### LinkedIn Post 2 - "Alignment Metrics Belong in Your Deck"

OpenAI + Apollo Research published hard data on model scheming, and California's SB 53 is waiting for Newsom's signature. Investors now expect deliberate-alignment curves and incident playbooks before they wire seed money. I outlined exactly what founders should baseline (covert-action rate, disclosure latency, whistleblower path) and how to turn safety transparency into a growth story. Details here.

### LinkedIn Post 3 - "RL Environments Are the New Data Flywheel"

Anthropic may spend $1B on reinforcement-learning environments. Mechanize, Prime Intellect, Mercor, and Surge are racing to become the "Scale AI for environments." If your product relies on agents, you need a budget and governance plan for synthetic worlds--today. I shared budgeting targets, SME pairing tips, and negotiation points for data rights in my latest briefing. Full breakdown inside.

### X Thread - "5 Signals AI Founders Can't Ignore (22 Sep 2025)"

1/ NVIDIA commits GBP 2B to the UK startup ecosystem + eyes $500M for Wayve. Compute capital is geopolitical strategy now.

2/ OpenAI + Apollo Research show scheming is real (and reducible). SB 53 will force public safety reports. Alignment telemetry is investor-grade data.

3/ Anthropic reportedly budgets $1B for RL environments. Synthetic worlds are the new supply chain.

4/ Embodied autonomy is commercial: end-to-end driving stacks demand hybrid teams, teleops, and ODD discipline.

5/ Apple iOS 26 + Meta Ray-Ban Display normalize gesture/voice/neural input. Interfaces must feel ambient by default.

Full architect's playbook (+ 30-day plan + metrics) live now. Link.
