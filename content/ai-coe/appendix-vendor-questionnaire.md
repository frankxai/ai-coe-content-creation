## Appendix C: Vendor Due-Diligence Questionnaire

Use these prompts during procurement or quarterly business reviews.

### Model Providers
1. What are your latest covert-action scores by task and model version? Provide evidence.
2. Describe your anti-scheming mitigation stack (deliberative prompts, training data filters, oversight). How do you verify effectiveness?
3. When was your last third-party audit on safety or alignment? Share summary findings?
4. How do you support customer-run evaluations? Do you offer evaluation APIs or sandbox access?
5. Detail your incident response SLA when a customer reports deceptive or harmful behavior.

### Hardware & Cloud Partners
1. What is your GPU availability outlook across regions (US, UK, EU, APAC) over the next 12 months?
2. How do you prioritize enterprise workloads during demand spikes? Are reservations guaranteed?
3. Provide carbon intensity metrics for each data center. What renewable commitments exist?
4. Outline your process for notifying customers about export control or policy changes impacting compute access.

### Wearable & Device Vendors
1. What privacy indicators and user controls are built into the device? Can customers customize them?
2. How do you secure data in transit and at rest? Is on-device processing supported for sensitive workloads?
3. What is your roadmap for accessibility features (motor, vision, cognitive accommodations)?
4. Describe your device management APIs--can we enforce remote wipe, geofencing, or usage policies?

### Simulation & RL Environment Suppliers
1. How do you source or generate task scenarios? Can customers inject proprietary workflows?
2. What governance exists to prevent environment drift or unintended bias?
3. Detail your human feedback pipeline--are annotators trained in our domain? Can we bring our own SMEs?
4. Explain pricing model (per task, per environment hour, subscription). Include compute charges.

### System Integrators & Consulting Partners
1. Provide case studies showing human-in-the-loop design outcomes (assist adoption, risk reduction).
2. How do you ensure compliance with SB 53-like regulations across engagements?
3. Share your talent bench--do you employ alignment engineers, simulation architects, autonomy specialists?
4. What change management artifacts do you deliver (playbooks, training materials, communication plans)?

Document vendor responses, assign risk scores, and revisit quarterly. Strong answers indicate maturity; vague replies signal hidden work for your team.
