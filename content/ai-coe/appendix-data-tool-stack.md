## Appendix B: Data & Tool Stack Upgrades for AI Startups

### Data Foundations
- **Metadata Catalog**: Tag datasets by residency and safety status (training, evaluation, incident logs).
- **Lineage Tracking**: Record model versions, environment iterations, and human feedback sessions.
- **Synthetic Data Pipelines**: Generate rare-edge trajectories for RL environments and red-team tests.

### MLOps Enhancements
- **Alignment Evaluator**: Automate covert-action tests in CI; fail builds above threshold.
- **Feature Store**: Partition features by residency (UK, EU, US) to match compute commitments.
- **Model Registry**: Log alignment techniques (deliberative prompts, guardrails) and rollback plans.

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Edge/On-Device Deployment**: Support Core ML/TensorFlow Lite builds for privacy-first experiences.
- **GPU Orchestrator**: Monitor multi-region capacity, carbon intensity, and price volatility.
- **Telemetry Streams**: Capture wearable usage, environment success rates, and human overrides in real time.

### Collaboration Platforms
- **Simulation Studio**: Let SMEs script RL tasks and annotate edge-case trajectories.
- **Alignment Workbench**: Compare pre/post mitigation outputs with reviewer comments.
- **Autonomy Ops Console**: Monitor interventions, ODD compliance, and teleoperation handoffs.

### Governance Automation
- **Policy Manager**: Version SB 53-style policies, assign owners, track attestations.
- **Reporting Engine**: Auto-build safety reports from alignment metrics and incident logs.
- **Audit Archive**: Store evaluation notebooks, environment changelogs, and disclosure evidence.

### Integration Checklist
- Enforce scoped tokens (OAuth2) across internal APIs.
- Use event-driven hooks to alert teams when metrics breach thresholds.
- Apply data-retention policies to cleanse environment logs after analysis.
