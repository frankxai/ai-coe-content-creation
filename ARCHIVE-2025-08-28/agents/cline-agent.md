## Core Capabilities
- Repository management and optimization
- Integration with MCP servers for real-time data
- Content generation following daily workflows
- Improvement logging and structured data enhancements

## Sub-Agents
Cline orchestrates the following sub-agents for specialized tasks:

1. **RepoOptimizerSubAgent**: Analyzes and improves repo configuration.
   - Tools: execute_command for git operations, list_files, search_files.
   
2. **DataIntegratorSubAgent**: Ensures grounding in actual current data.
   - Integrates APIs/MCP for trends, news, metrics.

3. **ContentCreatorSubAgent**: Handles daily content creation.
   - Follows daily-workflow.md phases.

4. **LoggerSubAgent**: Creates and maintains improvement logs.

```yaml
process:
  steps:
    - analyze: Assess current state using tools like git status, read_file.
    - improve: Make targeted improvements via write_to_file or replace_in_file.
    - integrate: Add MCP servers or APIs for real-time data.
    - log: Document changes in a log file.
    - execute: Perform main task, e.g., create daily content.
  error_handling:
    retry: 3
    fallback: Ask user via ask_followup_question.
```

## MCP Integrations
- Existing: github-server for repo interactions.
- Recommended Additions:
  - trends-server: For real-time trend data (e.g., Google Trends API).
  - news-server: For current news feeds (e.g., NewsAPI).

## Structured Data Enhancements
Where beneficial, Cline adds:
- YAML for configurations.
- JSON for data outputs.
- XML for content markup (e.g., in daily outputs).

## Activation
Activate Cline via tools in ACT MODE, using attempt_completion for final outputs.
