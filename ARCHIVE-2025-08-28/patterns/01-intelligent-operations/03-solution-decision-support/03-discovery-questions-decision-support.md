# Discovery Questions: Intelligent Decision Support

## Discovery & Current State Assessment

1. **What types of decisions are currently taking the longest to make in your organization, and what data sources are involved in those decisions?**
   - *Purpose: Identify high-impact use cases and understand existing data landscape*

2. **How are you currently collecting, storing, and analyzing data from your operational systems (ERP, CRM, IoT sensors, external APIs)?**
   - *Purpose: Assess data maturity and integration complexity for OCI Connector Hub implementation*

3. **What is your current decision-making process timeline, and where do you see the biggest bottlenecks in getting from data to actionable insights?**
   - *Purpose: Establish baseline for the 45% accuracy improvement and weeks-to-hours reduction claims*

## Strategy & Business Alignment

4. **What are your organization's top 3 strategic priorities for the next 2-3 years, and how do data-driven decisions support these goals?**
   - *Purpose: Align solution value proposition with business strategy*

5. **Which business functions (finance, manufacturing, retail, healthcare, energy) would benefit most from predictive insights and automated recommendations?**
   - *Purpose: Prioritize implementation approach and identify quick wins*

6. **How do you currently measure decision quality and business impact, and what KPIs would you use to evaluate the success of an intelligent decision support system?**
   - *Purpose: Establish success criteria and ROI measurement framework*

## Opportunity Qualification

7. **What is your annual budget allocation for data analytics and AI initiatives, and what ROI expectations do you have for decision support investments?**
   - *Purpose: Qualify budget authority and establish value expectations*

8. **Who are the key stakeholders and decision-makers who would need to approve and champion this type of solution across your organization?**
   - *Purpose: Identify buying committee and implementation sponsors*

9. **What is your preferred timeline for implementing an intelligent decision support solution, and are there any critical business events or deadlines driving this timeline?**
   - *Purpose: Understand urgency and project scheduling constraints*

## Technical Scoping & Architecture

10. **What is your current cloud infrastructure setup, and do you have any preferences or restrictions regarding Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) adoption?**
    - *Purpose: Assess technical fit and potential migration requirements*

11. **What are your data volume characteristics (daily ingestion rates, storage requirements, real-time vs. batch processing needs) and performance expectations for decision support queries?**
    - *Purpose: Size GPU compute resources (A10/A100) and database requirements*

12. **What existing AI/ML capabilities do you have in-house, and what level of model customization versus pre-built solutions would you prefer?**
    - *Purpose: Determine OCI Data Science platform requirements and Model Science needs*

## Security & Compliance

13. **What are your data security, privacy, and regulatory compliance requirements, particularly for sensitive business data used in decision-making?**
    - *Purpose: Design appropriate security architecture and access controls*

14. **Do you have any specific requirements for data residency, encryption standards, or audit trails for decision support systems?**
    - *Purpose: Configure OCI security features and compliance monitoring*

## Integration & Change Management

15. **What existing business applications and workflows would need to integrate with the decision support system, and how do you typically handle change management for new technology implementations?**
    - *Purpose: Plan integration architecture and adoption strategy*
