# Discovery Questions: Intelligent Orchestration & Workflow Automation

## Discovery & Current State Assessment

1. **What complex business processes does your organization currently manage manually (loan processing, patient care coordination, supply chain fulfillment, employee onboarding), and how many handoffs and approvals are involved?**
   - *Purpose: Identify automation opportunities and understand current process complexity*

2. **How long do your current end-to-end processes take to complete, and where do you see the biggest bottlenecks, delays, or manual interventions?**
   - *Purpose: Establish baseline for 65% completion time reduction and 90% manual handoff elimination*

3. **What systems and applications are involved in your business processes, and how do you currently coordinate activities across different departments and platforms?**
   - *Purpose: Assess integration complexity and orchestration requirements*

## Strategy & Business Alignment

4. **What are your organization's operational efficiency and customer experience goals, and how important is process automation to your competitive differentiation?**
   - *Purpose: Align solution capabilities with operational strategy and customer satisfaction objectives*

5. **Which business areas (financial services, healthcare, supply chain, HR, government, insurance) would benefit most from intelligent workflow orchestration, and what would be your priority processes?**
   - *Purpose: Prioritize implementation approach and identify highest-impact workflows*

6. **How do you currently measure process efficiency, compliance adherence, and customer satisfaction, and what KPIs would you use to evaluate workflow automation success?**
   - *Purpose: Establish success criteria and process performance benchmarks*

## Opportunity Qualification

7. **What is your annual budget for process improvement, business process management tools, and operational efficiency initiatives, and what cost savings do you expect from automation?**
   - *Purpose: Qualify budget authority and establish ROI expectations*

8. **Who are the key stakeholders (operations managers, process owners, compliance officers, IT leaders) who would need to approve workflow orchestration solutions?**
   - *Purpose: Identify buying committee and process champions*

9. **What is your preferred timeline for implementing intelligent workflow automation, and are there any regulatory, compliance, or customer experience pressures driving this timeline?**
   - *Purpose: Understand urgency and business requirements*

## Technical Scoping & Architecture

10. **What are your process volumes (transactions per day, concurrent workflows, peak processing periods) and what performance requirements do you have for process completion times?**
    - *Purpose: Size Oracle Integration and processing infrastructure requirements*

11. **What existing business systems (ERP, CRM, databases, legacy applications) would need to integrate with the workflow orchestration platform?**
    - *Purpose: Plan OCI Connector Hub integration and system connectivity*

12. **Do you have requirements for real-time process monitoring, dynamic workflow adjustment, and intelligent decision-making within automated processes?**
    - *Purpose: Configure OCI Events, Streaming, and AI-driven process optimization*

## Compliance & Governance

13. **What compliance and audit requirements do you have for business processes (SOX, regulatory approvals, industry standards), and what audit trails and documentation do you need to maintain?**
   - *Purpose: Design compliance monitoring and audit trail capabilities*

14. **What approval workflows, escalation procedures, and exception handling processes do you need to maintain within automated workflows?**
   - *Purpose: Configure human oversight and exception management processes*

## User Experience & Change Management

15. **How do you want users to interact with automated workflows (self-service portals, mobile apps, conversational interfaces), and what change management support will you need for process automation adoption?**
    - *Purpose: Plan Oracle Digital Assistant integration and user experience design*
