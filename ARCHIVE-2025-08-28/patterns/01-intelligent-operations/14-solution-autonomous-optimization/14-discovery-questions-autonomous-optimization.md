# Discovery Questions: Autonomous Process Optimization

## Discovery & Current State Assessment

1. **What business processes does your organization currently optimize manually (supply chain routing, production scheduling, energy distribution, portfolio management, patient flow), and how frequently do you make adjustments?**
   - *Purpose: Identify autonomous optimization opportunities and understand current manual intervention frequency*

2. **What is your current process efficiency and operational cost baseline, and how much time do your teams spend on process monitoring and adjustment activities?**
   - *Purpose: Establish baseline for 50% efficiency gains, 40% cost reduction, and 80% manual intervention elimination*

3. **What optimization challenges do you face with your current processes, and where do you see the biggest opportunities for continuous improvement?**
   - *Purpose: Understand optimization pain points and improvement potential*

## Strategy & Business Alignment

4. **What are your organization's operational excellence and competitive advantage goals, and how important is continuous process optimization to your market position?**
   - *Purpose: Align solution capabilities with operational strategy and competitive differentiation*

5. **Which business areas (supply chain, manufacturing, energy, logistics, finance, healthcare) would benefit most from autonomous process optimization, and what would be your priority processes?**
   - *Purpose: Prioritize implementation approach and identify highest-impact optimization opportunities*

6. **How do you currently measure process performance, resource utilization, and operational efficiency, and what KPIs would you use to evaluate autonomous optimization success?**
   - *Purpose: Establish success criteria and optimization performance benchmarks*

## Opportunity Qualification

7. **What is your annual budget for process improvement, optimization tools, and operational efficiency initiatives, and what business impact do you expect from autonomous optimization?**
   - *Purpose: Qualify budget authority and establish value expectations*

8. **Who are the key stakeholders (operations executives, process owners, continuous improvement leaders, plant managers) who would need to approve autonomous optimization solutions?**
   - *Purpose: Identify buying committee and optimization champions*

9. **What is your preferred timeline for implementing autonomous optimization, and are there any operational targets or competitive pressures driving this timeline?**
   - *Purpose: Understand urgency and business timing requirements*

## Technical Scoping & Architecture

10. **What types of process data and performance metrics do you currently collect, and what real-time data streams would be needed for autonomous optimization?**

    - *Purpose: Plan Oracle Integration Cloud connectivity and system orchestration*

12. **Do you have requirements for custom optimization algorithms, industry-specific constraints, and multi-objective optimization across different business goals?**
    - *Purpose: Configure OCI Data Science platform and optimization model development*

## Process Control & Governance

13. **What boundaries and constraints do you want to set for autonomous optimization (safety limits, business rules, approval thresholds), and what escalation procedures do you need for exceptional situations?**
    - *Purpose: Design governance framework and exception handling processes*

14. **What level of transparency and explainability do you require for autonomous optimization decisions, and what audit trails do you need to maintain?**
    - *Purpose: Configure decision transparency and compliance monitoring*
