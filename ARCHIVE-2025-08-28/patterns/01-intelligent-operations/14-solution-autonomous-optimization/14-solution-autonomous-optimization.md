# Design Pattern 14: Autonomous Process Optimization

## Business Value Proposition
Create self-optimizing business processes that continuously improve without human intervention. Achieve 50% efficiency gains, reduce operational costs by 40%, and eliminate 80% of manual process adjustments.

## User Stories
- As a supply chain manager, I want autonomous route optimization so my delivery network continuously improves without manual intervention
- As a production manager, I want self-optimizing manufacturing schedules so I can maximize efficiency while minimizing waste
- As an energy grid operator, I want autonomous load balancing so the system automatically adjusts to demand changes
- As a portfolio manager, I want self-rebalancing investment strategies so my portfolios optimize risk and return continuously
- As a hospital administrator, I want autonomous patient flow optimization so we can reduce wait times and improve care delivery
