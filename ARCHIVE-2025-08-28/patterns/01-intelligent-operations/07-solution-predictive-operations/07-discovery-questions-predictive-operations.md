# Discovery Questions: Predictive Operations & Maintenance

## Discovery & Current State Assessment

1. **What critical equipment, infrastructure, or systems does your organization operate (manufacturing equipment, fleet vehicles, utility grids, network infrastructure, production lines), and how do you currently handle maintenance and monitoring?**
   - *Purpose: Identify predictive maintenance opportunities and understand current operational practices*

2. **What is your current unplanned downtime frequency and cost, and how much do you spend annually on reactive maintenance versus planned maintenance?**
   - *Purpose: Establish baseline for 75% downtime reduction and 35% maintenance cost optimization*

3. **What types of failures or performance degradation do you experience most frequently, and how much advance warning do you typically have before equipment issues occur?**
   - *Purpose: Understand failure patterns and current predictive capabilities*

## Strategy & Business Alignment

4. **What are your organization's operational reliability and cost optimization goals, and how important is predictive maintenance to your business continuity strategy?**
   - *Purpose: Align solution capabilities with operational strategy and reliability objectives*

5. **Which business areas (manufacturing, transportation, utilities, telecommunications, oil & gas, aviation) would benefit most from predictive operations capabilities, and what would be your priority assets?**
   - *Purpose: Prioritize implementation approach and identify highest-impact equipment*

6. **How do you currently measure equipment effectiveness (OEE), maintenance costs, and operational reliability, and what KPIs would you use to evaluate predictive operations success?**
   - *Purpose: Establish success criteria and operational performance benchmarks*

## Opportunity Qualification

7. **What is your annual budget for maintenance operations, monitoring systems, and operational technology, and what cost savings do you expect from predictive maintenance?**
   - *Purpose: Qualify budget authority and establish ROI expectations*

8. **Who are the key stakeholders (maintenance managers, operations directors, plant managers, reliability engineers) who would need to approve predictive operations solutions?**
   - *Purpose: Identify buying committee and operational champions*

9. **What is your preferred timeline for implementing predictive operations, and are there any critical maintenance events or operational deadlines driving this timeline?**
   - *Purpose: Understand urgency and operational scheduling requirements*

## Technical Scoping & Architecture

10. **What types of sensor data and operational metrics do you currently collect (vibration, temperature, pressure, performance indicators), and what additional monitoring capabilities would you need?**
    - *Purpose: Assess current IoT infrastructure and plan OCI Streaming data ingestion*

11. **What existing maintenance management systems, SCADA systems, and operational databases would need to integrate with the predictive operations platform?**
    - *Purpose: Plan system integration and data pipeline architecture*

12. **Do you have requirements for real-time anomaly detection, custom failure prediction models, and automated maintenance scheduling based on predictive insights?**
    - *Purpose: Configure OCI Anomaly Detection, Data Science platform, and automation capabilities*

## Data & Analytics

13. **What historical maintenance and failure data do you have available for model training, and what data quality and completeness challenges do you face?**
    - *Purpose: Assess training data availability and plan model development approach*

14. **What level of prediction accuracy and advance warning time do you require for different types of equipment and failure modes?**
    - *Purpose: Configure prediction models and alert thresholds*

## Operations & Maintenance Integration

15. **How do you want to integrate predictive insights into your existing maintenance workflows, work order systems, and technician processes, and what mobile or field access capabilities do you need?**
    - *Purpose: Plan maintenance system integration and field operations support*
