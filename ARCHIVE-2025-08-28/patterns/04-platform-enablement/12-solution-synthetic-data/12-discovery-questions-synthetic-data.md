# Discovery Questions: Synthetic Data & Testing

## Discovery & Current State Assessment

1. **What types of data do you currently use for testing, development, and training (customer data, financial transactions, medical records, sensor data), and how do you currently handle data privacy and security in non-production environments?**
   - *Purpose: Identify synthetic data opportunities and understand current privacy challenges*

2. **How much time and resources do you currently spend on test data preparation, and what are your current testing coverage and development cycle times?**
   - *Purpose: Establish baseline for 70% development acceleration and 300% test coverage improvement*

3. **What data privacy regulations do you need to comply with (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA), and what challenges do you face in providing realistic test data while maintaining compliance?**
   - *Purpose: Assess privacy requirements and compliance constraints*

## Strategy & Business Alignment

4. **What are your organization's development velocity and quality goals, and how important is comprehensive testing to your product reliability and customer satisfaction?**
   - *Purpose: Align solution capabilities with development strategy and quality objectives*

5. **Which business areas (healthcare, financial services, software development, automotive, retail, telecommunications) would benefit most from synthetic data generation capabilities?**
   - *Purpose: Prioritize implementation approach and identify highest-impact use cases*

6. **How do you currently measure development productivity, test coverage, and data privacy compliance, and what KPIs would you use to evaluate synthetic data solutions?**
   - *Purpose: Establish success criteria and development performance benchmarks*

## Opportunity Qualification

7. **What is your annual budget for development tools, testing infrastructure, and data management, and what cost savings do you expect from synthetic data generation?**
   - *Purpose: Qualify budget authority and establish ROI expectations*

8. **Who are the key stakeholders (development managers, QA directors, data privacy officers, compliance leaders) who would need to approve synthetic data solutions?**
   - *Purpose: Identify buying committee and development champions*

9. **What is your preferred timeline for implementing synthetic data capabilities, and are there any critical product releases or compliance deadlines driving this timeline?**
   - *Purpose: Understand urgency and development scheduling requirements*

## Technical Scoping & Architecture

10. **What are your synthetic data volume requirements (records per dataset, datasets per month, real-time vs. batch generation), and what data formats and structures do you need to replicate?**
    - *Purpose: Size OCI Generative AI and processing infrastructure requirements*

11. **What existing development tools, testing frameworks, and CI/CD pipelines would need to integrate with the synthetic data generation platform?**
    - *Purpose: Plan OCI DevOps integration and API Gateway connectivity*

12. **Do you have requirements for maintaining statistical relationships, data correlations, and referential integrity in synthetic datasets?**
    - *Purpose: Configure OCI Data Science modeling and data generation algorithms*

## Data Quality & Validation

13. **What level of data realism and statistical accuracy do you require for different use cases (training ML models, stress testing, functional testing), and how do you want to validate synthetic data quality?**
    - *Purpose: Design validation frameworks and quality assurance processes*

14. **What edge cases, stress scenarios, and unusual data patterns do you need to generate for comprehensive testing coverage?**
    - *Purpose: Configure scenario generation and edge case modeling capabilities*

## Privacy & Security

15. **What are your requirements for ensuring synthetic data cannot be reverse-engineered to reveal original data, and what audit trails do you need for synthetic data usage and distribution?**
    - *Purpose: Design privacy protection mechanisms and usage tracking capabilities*
