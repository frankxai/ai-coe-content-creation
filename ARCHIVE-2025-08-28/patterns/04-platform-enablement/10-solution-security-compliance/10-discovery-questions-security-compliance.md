# Discovery Questions: AI-Powered Security & Compliance

## Discovery & Current State Assessment

1. **What security threats and compliance challenges does your organization currently face, and how do you currently detect, respond to, and report on security incidents?**
   - *Purpose: Identify security gaps and understand current threat detection capabilities*

2. **What is your current security incident response time and threat detection accuracy, and how much do you spend annually on security operations and compliance activities?**
   - *Purpose: Establish baseline for 99% detection rate, 85% response time reduction, and 50% compliance cost savings*

3. **What security tools, SIEM systems, and compliance frameworks are you currently using, and what are the main limitations of your existing security infrastructure?**
   - *Purpose: Assess current security stack and integration requirements*

## Strategy & Business Alignment

4. **What are your organization's security posture and risk management goals, and how important is proactive threat detection to your business continuity strategy?**
   - *Purpose: Align solution capabilities with security strategy and risk tolerance*

5. **Which business areas (financial services, healthcare, government, retail, energy, technology) have the highest security and compliance requirements, and what would be your priority use cases?**
   - *Purpose: Prioritize implementation approach and identify critical security applications*

6. **How do you currently measure security effectiveness, compliance adherence, and incident impact, and what KPIs would you use to evaluate AI-powered security solutions?**
   - *Purpose: Establish success criteria and security performance benchmarks*

## Opportunity Qualification

7. **What is your annual budget for cybersecurity tools, compliance activities, and security personnel, and what cost savings do you expect from automated security operations?**
   - *Purpose: Qualify budget authority and establish ROI expectations*

8. **Who are the key stakeholders (CISO, security directors, compliance officers, risk managers) who would need to approve AI-powered security solutions?**
   - *Purpose: Identify buying committee and security champions*

9. **What is your preferred timeline for implementing enhanced security capabilities, and are there any regulatory deadlines or security incidents driving this timeline?**
   - *Purpose: Understand urgency and compliance requirements*

## Technical Scoping & Architecture

10. **What are your security data volumes (logs per day, events per second, data retention requirements) and what real-time processing capabilities do you need for threat detection?**
    - *Purpose: Size OCI Logging, Cloud Guard, and processing infrastructure*

11. **What existing security systems (SIEM, firewalls, databases, applications) would need to integrate with the AI-powered security platform?**
    - *Purpose: Plan OCI Events integration and security ecosystem connectivity*

12. **Do you have requirements for custom threat detection models, industry-specific security patterns, and automated response workflows?**
    - *Purpose: Configure OCI Anomaly Detection and automated remediation capabilities*

## Compliance & Regulatory

13. **What regulatory compliance requirements do you need to meet (SOX, HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR, NERC, industry-specific), and what audit and reporting capabilities do you require?**
    - *Purpose: Design compliance monitoring and automated reporting features*

14. **What are your data classification, encryption, and access control requirements, particularly for sensitive data and critical systems?**
    - *Purpose: Configure OCI Data Safe, Vault, and access management controls*

## Incident Response & Operations

15. **What automated response capabilities do you want (threat isolation, user blocking, system patching, alert escalation), and what level of human oversight do you require for security actions?**
    - *Purpose: Design OCI Functions automation and security operations workflows*
