# Discovery Questions: Rapid Innovation & Experimentation

## Discovery & Current State Assessment

1. **What is your current AI/ML development process from concept to prototype, and how long does it typically take to validate new ideas or build proof-of-concepts?**
   - *Purpose: Establish baseline for months-to-days acceleration improvement*

2. **What development environments, tools, and infrastructure do you currently use for AI experimentation, and what are the main bottlenecks in your innovation pipeline?**
   - *Purpose: Understand current development setup and identify acceleration opportunities*

3. **How do you currently manage the transition from prototype to production for AI solutions, and what challenges do you face in scaling successful experiments?**
   - *Purpose: Assess production pipeline maturity and scaling requirements*

## Strategy & Business Alignment

4. **What are your organization's innovation goals and competitive positioning strategy, and how important is speed-to-market for AI capabilities to your business success?**
   - *Purpose: Align solution capabilities with innovation strategy and market timing*

5. **Which business areas (startup development, research institutions, innovation labs, consulting, technology companies) would benefit most from rapid AI prototyping capabilities?**
   - *Purpose: Prioritize implementation approach and identify highest-impact use cases*

6. **How do you currently measure innovation success, time-to-market, and development productivity, and what KPIs would you use to evaluate rapid innovation platforms?**
   - *Purpose: Establish success criteria and innovation performance benchmarks*

## Opportunity Qualification

7. **What is your annual budget for R&D, innovation initiatives, and development infrastructure, and what business impact do you expect from accelerated innovation cycles?**
   - *Purpose: Qualify budget authority and establish value expectations*

8. **Who are the key stakeholders (innovation directors, R&D leaders, CTO, product managers) who would need to approve rapid innovation platform investments?**
   - *Purpose: Identify buying committee and innovation champions*

9. **What is your preferred timeline for implementing rapid innovation capabilities, and are there any critical product launches or competitive pressures driving this timeline?**
   - *Purpose: Understand urgency and market timing requirements*

## Technical Scoping & Architecture

10. **What types of AI/ML experiments do you want to accelerate (computer vision, NLP, predictive analytics, generative AI), and what compute resources do you typically need for prototyping?**
