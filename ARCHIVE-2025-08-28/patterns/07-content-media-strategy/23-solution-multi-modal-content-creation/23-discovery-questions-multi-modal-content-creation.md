# Discovery Questions for Pattern 23: Sophisticated Multi-Modal Content Creation Workflow

These questions help tailor the pattern to your content creation needs. Answer them to define requirements and customize the agentic workflow for multi-modal (text, image, video, audio) content.

## General Questions
1. What are your primary content creation goals (e.g., speed up production, ensure consistency, enhance creativity)?
2. What multi-modal content types do you produce (e.g., videos with scripts, images with captions, podcasts)?
3. Who are your target audiences and channels (e.g., social media, websites, email campaigns)?

## Data and Integration
4. What assets or templates are available (e.g., brand guidelines, stock libraries, existing content repositories)?
5. Do you use third-party tools (e.g., Adobe Creative Suite, Canva) that need integration?
6. What data sources for inspiration or refinement (e.g., audience feedback, performance metrics)?

## Workflow and Agents
7. Describe your current creation process and pain points (e.g., time-consuming edits, consistency issues).
8. What level of agent autonomy is desired (e.g., auto-generate drafts vs. suggest refinements)?
9. How should agents handle iterations (e.g., based on team feedback or AI quality checks)?

## Performance and Scalability
10. What KPIs for content quality and output (e.g., production time, engagement rates)?
11. How much content do you create weekly/monthly, and what scalability is needed?
12. Any specific quality standards (e.g., resolution for images, tone for text)?

## Customization
13. Preferred OCI services or features (e.g., specific AI models for video generation)?
14. Are there regulatory or ethical considerations (e.g., copyright checks, bias mitigation)?
15. Unique requirements like accessibility features (e.g., alt text, subtitles) or multilingual support?
