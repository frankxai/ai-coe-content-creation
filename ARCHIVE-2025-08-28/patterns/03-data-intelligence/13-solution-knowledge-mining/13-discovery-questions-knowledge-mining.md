# Discovery Questions: Knowledge Mining & Discovery

## Discovery & Current State Assessment

1. **What types of unstructured content repositories does your organization maintain (research papers, legal documents, patents, financial reports, technical documentation), and how do you currently search and analyze this content?**
   - *Purpose: Identify knowledge sources and understand current research/discovery processes*

2. **How much time do your researchers, analysts, or knowledge workers currently spend searching for information, and what are the main challenges in finding relevant insights?**
   - *Purpose: Establish baseline for 10x research acceleration and 90% search time reduction*

3. **What knowledge discovery tools and processes do you currently use, and how do you identify patterns, relationships, and insights across large document collections?**
   - *Purpose: Assess current knowledge management maturity and discovery capabilities*

## Strategy & Business Alignment

4. **What are your organization's research, innovation, and competitive intelligence goals, and how important is rapid knowledge discovery to your strategic advantage?**
   - *Purpose: Align solution capabilities with research strategy and innovation objectives*

5. **Which business areas (pharmaceutical research, legal research, academic research, financial analysis, technology intelligence, government intelligence) would benefit most from automated knowledge mining?**
   - *Purpose: Prioritize implementation approach and identify highest-value use cases*

6. **How do you currently measure research productivity, discovery success rates, and knowledge utilization, and what KPIs would you use to evaluate knowledge mining effectiveness?**
   - *Purpose: Establish success criteria and research performance benchmarks*

## Opportunity Qualification

7. **What is your annual budget for research tools, information services, knowledge management systems, and research personnel, and what productivity gains do you expect from automated knowledge mining?**
   - *Purpose: Qualify budget authority and establish value expectations*

8. **Who are the key stakeholders (research directors, chief knowledge officers, legal partners, intelligence analysts) who would need to approve knowledge mining solutions?**
   - *Purpose: Identify buying committee and research champions*

9. **What is your preferred timeline for implementing knowledge mining capabilities, and are there any critical research projects or competitive pressures driving this timeline?**
   - *Purpose: Understand urgency and strategic timing requirements*

## Technical Scoping & Architecture

10. **What are your content volumes (number of documents, total data size, growth rates) and what types of content formats do you need to process (PDFs, academic papers, patents, web content, multimedia)?**
    - *Purpose: Size OCI Object Storage and processing infrastructure requirements*

11. **What existing knowledge management systems, research databases, and content repositories would need to integrate with the knowledge mining platform?**
    - *Purpose: Plan OCI Data Catalog integration and content ingestion pipelines*

12. **Do you have requirements for domain-specific entity recognition, custom knowledge graphs, and specialized search capabilities for your industry or research area?**
    - *Purpose: Configure OCI Language models and Oracle Database 23ai graph capabilities*

## Content & Domain Expertise

13. **What specialized terminology, concepts, and relationships are important in your domain, and do you have subject matter experts who can help train and validate knowledge extraction models?**
    - *Purpose: Plan domain-specific model training and validation processes*

14. **What are your content security, intellectual property, and confidentiality requirements for processing sensitive research or proprietary documents?**
    - *Purpose: Design secure processing architecture and access controls*

## Discovery & Visualization

15. **How do you want to explore and visualize discovered knowledge (interactive dashboards, knowledge graphs, research reports), and what collaboration features do you need for sharing insights across teams?**
    - *Purpose: Configure Oracle Analytics Cloud visualization and collaboration capabilities*
