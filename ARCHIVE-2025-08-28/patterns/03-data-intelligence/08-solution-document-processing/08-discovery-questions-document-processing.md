# Discovery Questions: Intelligent Document Processing

## Discovery & Current State Assessment

1. **What types of documents does your organization process most frequently (insurance claims, loan applications, medical records, contracts, tax documents), and what is your current processing workflow?**
   - *Purpose: Identify high-volume document types and understand existing processes*

2. **How much time and resources do you currently spend on document processing and data entry, and what are your current accuracy rates and error types?**
   - *Purpose: Establish baseline for 80% time reduction and 95% accuracy improvement claims*

3. **What document formats do you work with (PDFs, scanned images, handwritten forms, structured forms), and how do you currently extract and validate data from these documents?**
   - *Purpose: Assess document complexity and current extraction capabilities*

## Strategy & Business Alignment

4. **What are your organization's digital transformation and operational efficiency goals, and how important is document automation to your competitive advantage?**
   - *Purpose: Align solution capabilities with business strategy and transformation objectives*

5. **Which business functions (insurance, banking, healthcare, legal, government, real estate) would benefit most from intelligent document processing, and what would be your priority use cases?**
   - *Purpose: Prioritize implementation approach and identify highest-impact applications*

6. **How do you currently measure document processing efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction, and what KPIs would you use to evaluate automated document processing?**
   - *Purpose: Establish success criteria and performance benchmarks*

## Opportunity Qualification

7. **What is your annual budget for document processing operations, data entry services, and process automation technology, and what cost savings do you expect from automation?**
   - *Purpose: Qualify budget authority and establish ROI expectations*

8. **Who are the key stakeholders (operations managers, compliance officers, IT leaders, business process owners) who would need to approve document processing automation?**
   - *Purpose: Identify buying committee and process champions*

9. **What is your preferred timeline for implementing intelligent document processing, and are there any regulatory, compliance, or business deadlines driving this timeline?**
   - *Purpose: Understand urgency and compliance requirements*

## Technical Scoping & Architecture

10. **What are your document processing volumes (documents per day/month, peak periods, batch vs. real-time processing needs) and what processing speed requirements do you have?**
    - *Purpose: Size OCI Document Understanding and processing infrastructure*

11. **What existing business systems (CRM, ERP, case management, databases) would need to integrate with the document processing solution for data flow and workflow automation?**
    - *Purpose: Plan Oracle Integration Cloud connectivity and API Gateway architecture*

12. **Do you have requirements for custom document templates, industry-specific extraction rules, and validation workflows for different document types?**
    - *Purpose: Configure document understanding models and processing logic*

## Compliance & Quality Assurance

13. **What are your regulatory compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, industry-specific regulations) for document handling, data extraction, and audit trails?**
    - *Purpose: Design compliant processing workflows and audit capabilities*

14. **What quality assurance processes do you need for document processing, including human review workflows, exception handling, and accuracy validation?**
    - *Purpose: Configure validation processes and exception management*

## Data Management & Integration

15. **How do you want to handle extracted document data (direct system integration, data lakes, reporting databases), and what are your document archival and retrieval requirements?**
    - *Purpose: Plan Oracle Database 23ai integration and OCI Object Storage architecture for document management*
