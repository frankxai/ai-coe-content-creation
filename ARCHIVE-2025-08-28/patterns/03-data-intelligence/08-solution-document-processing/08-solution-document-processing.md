# Design Pattern 8: Intelligent Document Processing

## Business Value Proposition
Automate document-intensive processes with 95% accuracy. Reduce document processing time by 80%, eliminate manual data entry errors, and accelerate decision-making from days to minutes.

## User Stories
- As an insurance adjuster, I want automated claims document processing so I can focus on complex case analysis instead of data entry
- As a loan processor, I want intelligent application review so I can make faster, more accurate lending decisions
- As a medical records clerk, I want automated patient document digitization so I can improve care coordination and reduce errors
- As a legal assistant, I want contract analysis automation so I can identify key terms and risks more efficiently
- As a tax professional, I want automated document extraction so I can process returns faster during busy season

## Industry Applications
- **Insurance**: Claims processing, policy underwriting, compliance documentation
- **Banking**: Loan applications, KYC documents, account opening forms
- **Healthcare**: Medical records, insurance forms, patient intake documents
- **Legal**: Contract analysis, discovery documents, case file processing
