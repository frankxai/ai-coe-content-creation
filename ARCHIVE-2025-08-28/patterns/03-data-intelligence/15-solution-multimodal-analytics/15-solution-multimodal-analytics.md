# Design Pattern 15: Multi-Modal AI Analytics

## Business Value Proposition
Gain comprehensive insights by analyzing text, voice, and visual data simultaneously. Improve decision accuracy by 65% through holistic understanding, uncovering patterns invisible to single-mode analysis.

## User Stories
- As a retail analyst, I want combined video, audio, and transaction analysis so I can understand complete customer behavior patterns
- As a security officer, I want multi-modal threat detection so I can identify risks through visual, audio, and text signals simultaneously
- As a healthcare provider, I want integrated patient assessment so I can analyze symptoms across visual, voice, and medical record data
- As a smart city planner, I want unified urban analytics so I can understand city dynamics through cameras, sensors, and citizen feedback
- As a content moderator, I want multi-modal content analysis so I can detect inappropriate material across video, audio, and text
