# Discovery Questions: Multi-Modal AI Analytics

## Discovery & Current State Assessment

1. **What types of data do you currently analyze separately (text documents, audio recordings, video content, sensor data), and how do you currently correlate insights across these different data types?**
   - *Purpose: Identify multi-modal data sources and understand current analysis limitations*

2. **What business scenarios require understanding of multiple data types simultaneously (customer behavior analysis, security monitoring, patient assessment, urban planning), and how do you currently approach these complex analyses?**
   - *Purpose: Establish baseline for 65% accuracy improvement through holistic understanding*

3. **What are the current limitations of your single-mode analysis approaches, and where do you suspect you might be missing important patterns or insights?**
   - *Purpose: Identify gaps that multi-modal analysis could address*

## Strategy & Business Alignment

4. **What are your organization's analytics and decision-making goals, and how important is comprehensive situational awareness to your competitive advantage?**
   - *Purpose: Align solution capabilities with analytics strategy and decision-making objectives*

5. **Which business areas (retail analytics, healthcare assessment, security operations, smart city management, media analysis, automotive monitoring) would benefit most from multi-modal AI analytics?**
   - *Purpose: Prioritize implementation approach and identify highest-impact use cases*

6. **How do you currently measure analysis accuracy, decision quality, and operational effectiveness, and what KPIs would you use to evaluate multi-modal analytics success?**
   - *Purpose: Establish success criteria and performance benchmarks*

## Opportunity Qualification

7. **What is your annual budget for analytics tools, data processing infrastructure, and AI/ML initiatives, and what business impact do you expect from improved analysis accuracy?**
   - *Purpose: Qualify budget authority and establish value expectations*

8. **Who are the key stakeholders (analytics leaders, operations managers, security directors, research executives) who would need to approve multi-modal analytics solutions?**
   - *Purpose: Identify buying committee and analytical champions*

9. **What is your preferred timeline for implementing multi-modal analytics, and are there any critical business events or operational needs driving this timeline?**
   - *Purpose: Understand urgency and business timing requirements*

## Technical Scoping & Architecture

10. **What are your multi-modal data volumes (video hours, audio recordings, document counts, real-time streams) and what processing speed requirements do you have for integrated analysis?**
    - *Purpose: Size GPU compute resources (A100/H100) and streaming processing capabilities*

11. **What existing data sources and systems (cameras, microphones, document repositories, sensors, databases) would need to integrate with the multi-modal analytics platform?**
    - *Purpose: Plan OCI Streaming integration and data synchronization requirements*

12. **Do you have requirements for real-time multi-modal analysis, historical pattern discovery, and custom fusion algorithms for your specific use cases?**
    - *Purpose: Configure OCI Data Science platform and fusion model development*

## Data Synchronization & Quality

13. **How do you currently handle temporal alignment of different data types (matching video with audio, correlating sensor data with events), and what data quality standards do you maintain?**
    - *Purpose: Design data synchronization and quality assurance processes*

14. **What are your data privacy, security, and compliance requirements when processing multiple types of sensitive data simultaneously?**
    - *Purpose: Configure multi-modal security architecture and access controls*

## Analytics & Visualization

15. **How do you want to visualize and interact with multi-modal insights (unified dashboards, correlation matrices, timeline views), and what decision-making workflows need to be supported?**
    - *Purpose: Configure Oracle Analytics Cloud for multi-modal visualization and decision support integration*
