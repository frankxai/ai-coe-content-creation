# Design Pattern 4: Visual Intelligence & Automation

## Business Value Proposition
Automate visual tasks and gain insights from images and video. Reduce manual inspection time by 80% and improve accuracy of visual analysis.

## User Stories
- As a quality control manager, I want automated defect detection so I can maintain product standards without manual inspection delays
- As a security officer, I want intelligent surveillance analysis so I can identify threats in real-time across multiple locations
- As a radiologist, I want AI-assisted medical imaging analysis so I can provide faster, more accurate diagnoses
- As a retail manager, I want automated inventory tracking through visual recognition so I can optimize stock levels efficiently
- As a farmer, I want drone-based crop monitoring so I can detect issues early and maximize yield

## Industry Applications
- **Manufacturing**: Quality inspection, defect detection, assembly verification
- **Security**: Surveillance analysis, access control, threat detection
- **Healthcare**: Medical imaging analysis, diagnostic support
- **Retail**: Inventory management, customer behavior analysis, loss prevention
