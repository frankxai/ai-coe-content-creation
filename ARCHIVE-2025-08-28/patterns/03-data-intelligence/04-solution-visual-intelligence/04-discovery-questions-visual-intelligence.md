# Discovery Questions: Visual Intelligence & Automation

## Discovery & Current State Assessment

1. **What visual inspection, monitoring, or analysis tasks does your organization currently perform manually, and how much time and resources are dedicated to these activities?**
   - *Purpose: Identify automation opportunities and establish baseline for 80% time reduction*

2. **What types of visual content do you work with (manufacturing quality control, security surveillance, medical imaging, inventory tracking, agricultural monitoring), and what are your current accuracy rates?**
   - *Purpose: Understand visual intelligence use cases and current performance benchmarks*

3. **How do you currently capture, store, and analyze visual data (images, videos), and what systems are involved in your visual workflows?**
   - *Purpose: Assess current visual data infrastructure and integration requirements*

## Strategy & Business Alignment

4. **What are your organization's operational efficiency and quality improvement goals, and how important is automated visual analysis to achieving these objectives?**
   - *Purpose: Align solution capabilities with operational strategy*

5. **Which business areas (manufacturing, security, healthcare, retail, agriculture) would benefit most from intelligent visual automation, and what would be your priority use cases?**
   - *Purpose: Prioritize implementation approach and identify highest-impact applications*

6. **How do you currently measure quality, accuracy, and efficiency in visual tasks, and what KPIs would you use to evaluate AI-powered visual intelligence?**
   - *Purpose: Establish success criteria and performance benchmarks*

## Opportunity Qualification

7. **What is your annual budget for quality control, security systems, inspection equipment, and automation technology, and what ROI do you expect from visual intelligence investments?**
   - *Purpose: Qualify budget authority and establish value expectations*

8. **Who are the key stakeholders (operations managers, quality directors, security leaders, IT executives) who would need to approve visual intelligence solutions?**
   - *Purpose: Identify buying committee and operational champions*

9. **What is your preferred timeline for implementing visual intelligence capabilities, and are there any compliance, safety, or operational deadlines driving this timeline?**
   - *Purpose: Understand urgency and regulatory requirements*

## Technical Scoping & Architecture

10. **What are your visual data volumes (images/videos per day, resolution requirements, real-time vs. batch processing needs) and what processing speed expectations do you have?**
    - *Purpose: Size GPU compute resources (A100/H100) and processing requirements*

11. **What existing systems (manufacturing equipment, security cameras, medical devices, inventory systems) would need to integrate with the visual intelligence platform?**
    - *Purpose: Plan Oracle Integration and system connectivity requirements*

12. **Do you have specific requirements for model training, custom visual recognition, and accuracy thresholds for different types of visual analysis?**
    - *Purpose: Configure OCI Data Science platform and computer vision model development*

## Data & Storage

13. **What are your visual data storage requirements, retention policies, and access patterns, and do you need to maintain historical visual data for compliance or analysis?**
    - *Purpose: Design OCI Object Storage architecture and data lifecycle management*

14. **What are your data security and privacy requirements for visual content, particularly for sensitive applications like medical imaging or security surveillance?**
    - *Purpose: Configure appropriate security controls and access management*

## Performance & Accuracy

15. **What accuracy levels do you require for different visual analysis tasks, and how do you currently handle exceptions, false positives, and quality assurance in visual processes?**
    - *Purpose: Design validation workflows and exception handling processes*
