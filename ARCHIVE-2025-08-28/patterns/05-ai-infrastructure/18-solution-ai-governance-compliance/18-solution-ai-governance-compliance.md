# Design Pattern 18: AI Governance & Compliance Framework

## Business Value Proposition
Ensure responsible AI deployment with comprehensive governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance. Reduce compliance risk by 80% and accelerate audit processes from weeks to days.

## User Stories
- As a Chief Risk Officer, I want comprehensive AI risk assessment so I can ensure responsible AI deployment across the organization
- As a compliance officer, I want automated audit trails so I can demonstrate regulatory compliance to auditors efficiently
- As a data protection officer, I want bias detection and mitigation so I can ensure fair and ethical AI outcomes
- As an AI ethics committee member, I want explainable AI capabilities so I can validate model decisions and recommendations
- As a business leader, I want AI impact assessments so I can understand the societal and business implications of AI initiatives

## Industry Applications
- **Financial Services**: Credit decisions, loan approvals, risk assessment with fair lending compliance
- **Healthcare**: Clinical decision support, treatment recommendations with patient safety and privacy
- **Government**: Public service automation, benefit determination with transparency and accountability
- **Human Resources**: Hiring algorithms, performance evaluation with anti-discrimination compliance
- **Insurance**: Claims processing, underwriting with actuarial fairness and regulatory compliance

## Implementation Approach
1. **Governance Framework**: Establish AI ethics committee, policies, and review processes
2. **Risk Assessment**: Implement AI risk scoring and impact assessment workflows
3. **Compliance Automation**: Deploy automated monitoring and audit trail generation
4. **Bias Detection**: Implement fairness testing and bias mitigation techniques
5. **Explainability**: Deploy model interpretability and explanation generation capabilities

## Core Components
| Component | Role | Business Impact |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **OCI AI Services** | Model interpretability and explanation | Transparent, explainable AI decisions |
| **OCI Data Safe** | Data privacy and protection monitoring | Enhanced data governance and compliance |
