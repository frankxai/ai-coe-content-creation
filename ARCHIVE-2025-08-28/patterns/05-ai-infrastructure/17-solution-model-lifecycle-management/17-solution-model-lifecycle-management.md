# Design Pattern 17: AI Model Lifecycle Management (MLOps)

## Business Value Proposition
Accelerate AI model development and deployment by 70% while ensuring reliability, compliance, and governance. Reduce model deployment time from months to days with automated MLOps pipelines.

## User Stories
- As a data scientist, I want automated model versioning so I can track experiments and reproduce results easily
- As an ML engineer, I want CI/CD pipelines for models so I can deploy updates safely and quickly
- As a compliance officer, I want model governance and audit trails so I can ensure regulatory compliance
- As a product manager, I want A/B testing capabilities so I can validate model performance in production
- As an operations team, I want automated monitoring and alerting so I can detect model drift and performance issues

## Industry Applications
- **Financial Services**: Credit scoring models, fraud detection, risk assessment with regulatory compliance
- **Healthcare**: Diagnostic models, treatment recommendations, drug discovery with FDA validation
- **Retail**: Recommendation engines, demand forecasting, price optimization with rapid experimentation
- **Manufacturing**: Quality control models, predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization
- **Telecommunications**: Network optimization, customer churn prediction, service quality monitoring

## Implementation Approach
1. **Foundation Setup**: Establish MLOps infrastructure and governance framework
2. **Model Development**: Implement standardized development and experimentation workflows
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Deploy automated testing, validation, and deployment pipelines
4. **Production Monitoring**: Implement model performance monitoring and drift detection
5. **Governance & Compliance**: Establish model registry, documentation, and audit capabilities
