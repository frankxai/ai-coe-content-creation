# Improvement Log - 2025-08-25

## Repository Status Check
- Executed 'git status' which showed not a git repository.
- Initialized git repository with 'git init'.
- Re-checked 'git status' confirming initialization and listing untracked files.

## Configuration Improvements
- Analyzed daily-workflow.md and overall-strategy.md for optimal setup.
- No claude.md found, so created agents/cline-agent.md defining Cline processes, sub-agents (RepoOptimizer, DataIntegrator, ContentCreator, Logger), YAML process definition, MCP recommendations, and structured enhancements.

## Grounding in Truth
- Deferred API/MCP additions per user instruction; planned for next stage (e.g., trends-server, news-server).

## Structured Enhancements
- Added YAML for process definition in cline-agent.md.
- Recommended JSON/XML where beneficial in daily outputs.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to daily content creation.
- Future: Add MCP servers for real-time data.
