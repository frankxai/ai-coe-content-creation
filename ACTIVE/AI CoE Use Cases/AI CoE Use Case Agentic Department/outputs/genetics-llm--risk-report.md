# Document changes made during claims validation and residual risks

## Summary
This report summarizes the validation of content assets for the genetics-llm use case. All claims have been reviewed against approved sources of truth, with corrections applied to ensure credibility and compliance.

## Validation Results
- **Total Claims Reviewed**: 4
- **High Confidence Claims**: 1
- **Medium Confidence Claims**: 2

- **Publish Gate Status**: PASSED

## Key Changes Made
### Content Corrections
- Replaced "Oracle's AI-powered genomics platform" with "reference architectures on OCI"
- Changed "100x faster analysis" to "significant speedups observed in POCs"
- Replaced "90% cost reduction" with "potential TCO reductions"
- Removed "2-3x higher success rates" and "500M+ revenue" claims as unsupported
- Corrected "unprecedented accuracy" to "support predictive modeling"

### Qualifications Added
- Added "results vary by workload" to speed claims
- Qualified cost savings as "depending on utilization"
- Added "may improve efficiency" to success claims
- Changed "guaranteed" to conditional language throughout

## Residual Risks
### Low Risk Items
- Medium confidence claims (speedups, TCO) have POC backing and clear qualifications
- Peer-reviewed source for AI efficiency claims provides scientific grounding

### No Risk Items
- High confidence claim (OCI services) fully backed by Oracle documentation
- All claims now reflect platform capabilities, not customer assurances

## Compliance Notes
- Healthcare claims reflect OCI platform features supporting HIPAA/GDPR
- No customer-specific guarantees or treatment efficacy claims
- All quantitative assertions have sources or are framed as potential/directional

## Recommendations
- Monitor performance metrics to validate speed and cost claims in future POCs
- Consider obtaining additional peer-reviewed sources for AI efficiency claims
- Regular review of Oracle documentation links for currency
