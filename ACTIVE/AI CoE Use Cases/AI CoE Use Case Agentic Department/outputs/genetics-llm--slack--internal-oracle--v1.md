Hi Team,
We are working on an AI CoE driven Use case that hopefully inspires you!
Industry: Life Sciences (Pharma/Biotech)
Case: Accelerating genomics analysis on OCI using a reference architecture that leverages OCI Generative AI Service, OCI Data Science, and Data Lakehouse for more efficient processing of large sequencing datasets.

**Why it matters:**
- Shorter analysis cycles for massive genomic data volumes
- Elastic compute to optimize cost and throughput
- Built-in security features supporting compliance needs

**Enablement Resources:**
- Full use case: [Link to Genetics LLM Use Case.md]
- Demo scripts: [OCI Generative AI Service Demo]
- Technical overview: [OCI Data Science Platform]

**How this can be used in other Industries:**
- Healthcare: clinical document triage and coding with similar LLM orchestration
- Public sector: pathogen surveillance across large genomic datasets
- Agriculture: trait discovery at population scale
- Manufacturing: anomaly detection and multimodal signal analysis

**CTA:** Reply with your territory for targeted enablement sessions.
