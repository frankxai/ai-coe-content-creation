**Post Title:** The Real Bottleneck in Drug Discovery—and What We're Doing About It

**Post Content:**

If you work in drug discovery, the bottleneck isn't ideas—it's time.

In the last few months, my team at Oracle has been working with life sciences groups who are exploring AI to accelerate parts of their genomics analysis. The goal isn't to replace proven tools—it's to clear the queue: reduce manual steps, make pipelines more repeatable, and help researchers test more hypotheses faster.

We've been building out a reference architecture on OCI that combines Generative AI Service (for model hosting/adapters), Data Science (for experimentation/MLOps), and Data Lakehouse (for large-scale storage/analytics). In practice, that looks like: structured ingestion, well-governed data access, GPU-accelerated steps where they help, and careful hand-offs back to existing bioinformatics workflows.

A few patterns stand out:
- Keep the humans in the loop. The best outcomes pair expert judgment with assistive AI.
- Start with orchestration and observability. If you can't see the pipeline, you can't improve it.
- Be precise with claims. Use POC data where you have it; qualify where you don't.

What this isn't: a promise of overnight 100x gains. What it can be: a path to fewer bottlenecks, faster iteration, and better use of the compute you already have.

If you're exploring similar work—either in life sciences or another domain where data pipelines slow research—happy to compare notes on what a pragmatic rollout looks like on Oracle Cloud.
