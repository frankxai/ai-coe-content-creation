## Tools Used

- SEO analysis tools
- Brand voice checkers
- Content performance predictors

## Voice/Tone Profile
- **Oracle AI Architect**: First-person perspective ("In the last few months, my team and I..."), concrete examples, precise language, no hype
- Avoid absolute claims; use "we've seen," "teams report," "in POCs"
- Human narrative: include a scene, lesson learned, or personal insight

## Narrative Scaffolds
- **LinkedIn Post**: Hook (question/problem) → Context (what we're doing) → What We Built (architecture overview) → Lessons Learned (3 bullets) → Invitation/CTA (question to spark comments)
- **Slack Message**: Greeting → Industry/Case → Why it matters (3 bullets) → Cross-industry applications (4 bullets) → Enablement/CTA

## Quality Rubrics (Pass ≥ 22/30)
- **Human Voice/Authenticity (0-5)**: Sounds like a person, not AI; includes first-person, concrete examples
- **Clarity/Specificity (0-5)**: Precise language, no vague claims; grounded in OCI services
- **Credibility (0-5)**: No overclaiming; sources cited; qualifications included
- **Scannability (0-5)**: Short paragraphs, whitespace, emoji used sparingly
- **Audience Relevance (0-5)**: Addresses pain points; appropriate for exec/practitioner
- **CTA Strength (0-5)**: Invites conversation; no aggressive selling

## Platform Constraints
- **LinkedIn Post**: 120-220 words; 1-3 short paras; 3-5 focused hashtags; 1 question at end
