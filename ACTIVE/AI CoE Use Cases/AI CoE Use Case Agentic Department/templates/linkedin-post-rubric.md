# Evaluate content quality for LinkedIn posts (0-5 per dimension, pass â‰¥ 22/30)

## Dimensions

### Human Voice/Authenticity (0-5)
- 5: Sounds like a personal story from an Oracle AI Architect; first-person, concrete examples
- 3: Somewhat human but generic; some first-person elements
- 1: AI-generated feel; no personal touch

### Clarity/Specificity (0-5)
- 5: Precise language, no vague claims; grounded in OCI services with clear examples
- 3: Generally clear but some ambiguous terms
- 1: Vague, buzzword-heavy, hard to understand

### Credibility (0-5)
- 5: No overclaiming; sources cited; qualifications included; evidence-based
- 3: Some claims qualified but others bold; partial sourcing
- 1: Overpromising; no qualifications; unsupported assertions

### Scannability (0-5)
- 5: Short paragraphs, whitespace, emoji used sparingly, easy to read on mobile
- 3: Decent structure but could be more scannable
- 1: Wall of text; hard to parse quickly

### Audience Relevance (0-5)
- 5: Directly addresses executive/practitioner pain points; appropriate tone and depth
- 3: Relevant but could better tailor to audience
- 1: Off-target; doesn't resonate with intended readers

### CTA Strength (0-5)
- 5: Invites genuine conversation; includes question to spark comments; no aggressive selling
- 3: Has a CTA but weak or generic
- 1: No CTA or pushy sales pitch
