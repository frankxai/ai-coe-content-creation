    <task>Create a detailed, SEO-optimized outline for an article on the topic of **[TOPIC]**.</task>
    <instructions>
      - Use the research summary provided by the Research Agent as your single source of truth.
      - Craft a compelling, keyword-rich title and meta description.
      - Identify the primary, secondary, and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) keywords for the article.
      - Design a logical and intuitive structure for the article, using headings (H1, H2, H3) to create a clear hierarchy. The outline should be detailed enough for the Writing Agent to follow without needing to do any additional research.
      - For each section of the outline, provide a brief description of the content, the key points to be covered, and the narrative purpose of the section.
      - Identify specific opportunities for storytelling, data visualization (e.g., charts, graphs), and other engaging content formats (e.g., pull quotes, call-to-action boxes).
      - Do not include any information that is not supported by the research summary.
